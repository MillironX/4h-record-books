		Over half of your 4-H career is spent working on projects, and fittingly, over half of your record book is spent commemorating those projects.
		Section 1 provides a framework for planning, completing, and analysing each of your 4-H projects.
		How? Let's go through it step-by-step.

			When completing a project record for a project carried over from another organization (i.e. a school art project or the Supreme Beef program), the documentation from that organization may fit the criteria for a 4-H project record, and many people choose to submit that documentation as their section 1.
			This is acceptable, but the record book committee asks that you respect the judges' time by using the 4-H project record template, and not including extranneous information.

		Goals

	<blockquote>
		If you aim at nothing, you will hit it every time
		<small>Zig Ziglar</small>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Goals provide direction for your 4-H project. If you've ever gone to any motivational leadership conference, you've heard about goals far more than you could ever care to, but the facts show the people with goals acomplish more. Great, you say, how do you make goals? I'm glad you asked.</p>
	<p>A goal is an objective or thing desired to happen with SMARTY attributes:</p>
	<table class="table table-responsive">
		<tr>
		<th>

					<strong>Specific</strong><br/>
					A goal should only cover one area

						<dt>Bad Example</dt>
						<dd>To walk my dog two miles every day this summer and teach her to fetch</dd>
						<dt>Good Example</dt>
						<dd>
							To walk my dog two miles every day
							<br />
							To teach my dog how to fetch
						</dd>
					</dl>
					This goal needed to be split into two goals.
					Having more goals is great: just make sure that each goal stands alone.

				<strong>Measurable</strong><br/>
				Someone else should be able to objectively tell if you've met the goal or not.
				<dl class="dl-horizontal">
					<dt>Bad Example</dt>
					<dd>To shoot really well this year in .22</dd>
					<dt>Good Example</dt>
					<dd>To shoot an average of over 250 points over all my .22 practice shoots this year</dd>
				</dl>
				Measurable usually involves numbers or binary (true/false) statements.
				Notice how this example added a way of measuring (average) and a quantitative target (over 250 points).
				That is characteristic of measureable goals.					
				</p>
				<h5>What about <em>To do better than last year?</em></h5>
				<p>
					Invariably, record books are turned in each year with the goal "to do better than last year."
					Sometimes this is measurable, mostly it is not.
					It would be far better to identify exactly what you want to improve and find a way to measure that.
					If you do resort to this goal, you <b>MUST</b> keep your record book maticulously organised so that the judges can find how you did last year.

					<strong>Achievable/Attainable</strong><br/>

						<dt>Bad Example</dt>
						<dd>To finish my market hog at a weight between 245 and 280 lbs.</dd>
						<dt>Good Example</dt>
						<dd>To learn how protein percentage in feed affects rate of gain in hogs</dd>
					</dl>
					This does not mean that you cannot ask for help acomplishing your goals, but you do need to be in charge and take initiative for your goals.
					No human being can directly control an animal's behavior or weight, another persons opinions, or the weather.
					Make sure that your goals do not try to alter these things.

			For many years, the role of the project description was very ambiguous.
			As such, there are very few record books that followed these guidelines, and most of the examples do not.
			Please use discernment when viewing the example project descriptions, and remember to use the reporter-like style when completing your record book.
			Who knows, then your book might wind up in the next set of examples.

	<p>
		Knowledge &amp; Skills Acquired serves two purposes.
		First, it allows you to address whether or not you met your goals.
		Second, it tells readers what you actually learned this year in your project.
	</p>
	<p>
		To complete Knowledge &amp; Skills, create a heading for each <a href="#goals">goal</a> you wrote.
		Write a paragraph (at least three sentences) explaining if you met the goal, how you met the goal (or why you did not meet the goal), and what you learned from the goal.
		After each goal is addressed, include paragraphs explaining anything else you learned about your project area.
		Remember that your readers might not know anything about your project area, so be sure to explain it in a way that a layperson can understand.
