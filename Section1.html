	<p>
		Well, on <em>that</em> encouraging note, let's talk about the most involved section of a record book.
		Every project you are enrolled in needs a separate Section 1 for each year you are enrolled in it.
		Section 1 takes up the most time and space in a vetern 4-Her's record book, so we will spend a good deal of time talking about it here.

	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Here's an exercise I want you to try at home.
		Before you start a 4-H project, get out a blank sheet of paper.
		At the top, write down why you want to be in this project this year.
		Then, underneath that write down four or five things you broadly want to acomplish this year in this project.
		Now, like any organized and motivated individual, lose the sheet of paper and don't look at it for three months.
		If you followed the instructions, you will probably find that you have already made significant progress toward those four or five items you wanted to acomplish.
		If so, then take this oportunity to solidify your broad objectives into <strong>GOALS</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Goals are desired acomplishments that are <strong>SMARTY</strong>.
		Here's what that means:
	</p>
	<table class="table table-responsive">
		<tr>
			<th>
				<h3>S</h3>
			</th>
			<td>
				<p>
					<strong>Specific</strong><br/>
					Goals must be to-the-point.
					They cannot deal with more than one subject at a time.
				</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<th>
				<h3>M</h3>
			</th>
			<td>
				<strong>Measurable</strong><br/>
				Goals must have a fully objective way to tell if you've acomplished them or not.
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<th>
				<h3>A</h3>
			</th>
			<td>
				<strong>Acheivable/Attainable</strong><br/>
				Attaining the goals must be fully in your control, not another person, animal or circumstance.
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<th>
				<h3>R</h3>
			</th>
			<td>
				<strong>Realistic</strong><br/>
				Make sure your goals are actually something that can be attained in real life.
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<th>
				<h3>T</h3>
			</th>
			<td>
				<strong>Time-bound</strong><br/>
				Goals should always have a time by which they should be acheived.
				(Hint: in terms of record books, the end of the 4-H year is always a good time limit!)
			</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<th>
				<h3>Y</h3>
			</th>
			<td>
				<strong>Why</strong><br/>
				Goals should always be motivated by a good reason or higher purpose.
				Sometimes, you will need goals just for the sake of completing your record book, but try to keep those to a minimum.
				(Remember the goal exercise!)

			For many years, the role of the project description was very ambiguous.
			As such, there are very few record books that followed these guidelines, and most of the examples do not.
			Please use discernment when viewing the example project descriptions, and remember to use the reporter-like style when completing your record book.
			Who knows, then your book might wind up in the next set of examples.
