      <p>Most of your 4-H career is spent working on projects, and fittingly, a majority of your record book is spent commemorating those projects.
        Section 1 provides a framework for planning, completing, and analyzing each of your 4-H projects.
        How? Let's go through it step-by-step. </p>
      <div class="panel panel-warning">
        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h3 class="panel-title"> <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-edit"></span> Note </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body"> When completing a project record for a project carried over from another organization (i.e. a school art project or the Supreme Beef program), the documentation from that organization may fit the criteria for a 4-H project record, and many people choose to submit that documentation as their Section 1.
          This is acceptable, but the record book committee asks that you respect the judges' time by using the 4-H project record template, and not including extraneous information. </div>

      <h2><a id="overview"></a>Overview </h2>
      <p> Please just fill this box out.
        It's really not that hard, and I'd rather not waste the space (or the bandwidth) to explain in detail.
        If you really have questions, contact the Extension Office. </p>
      <h2><a id="goals"></a>Goals</h2>
      <blockquote> If you aim at nothing, you will hit it every time <small>Zig Ziglar</small> </blockquote>
      <p>Goals provide direction for your 4-H project. If you've ever gone to any motivational leadership conference, you've heard about goals far more than you could ever care to, but the facts show the people with goals accomplish more. Great, you say, how do you make goals? I'm glad you asked.</p>
      <p>A goal is an objective or thing desired to happen with SMARTY attributes:</p>

            <p> Measurable usually involves numbers or binary (true/false) statements.
              Notice how this example added a way of measuring (average) and a quantitative target (over 250 points).
              That is characteristic of measurable goals. </p>
            <h5>What about <em style="font-style: normal;">To do better than last year</em>?</h5>
            <p> Invariably, record books are turned in each year with the goal "to do better than last year."
              Sometimes this is measurable, Usually it is not.
              It would be far better to identify exactly what you want to improve and find a way to measure that.
              If you do resort to this goal, you <strong>MUST</strong> keep your record book meticulously organized so that the judges can find how you did last year. </p>            <hr />

            Make sure that your goals do not try to alter these things.

            <p>
            No 4-Her could have the money to buy materials for 20 saddles, or the time to make 20 saddles within one month: that is unrealistic.
            Difficulty can also play a role here.
            Making one coaster should not be a challenge for an experienced leathercrafter and would be unrealistic, but might be appropriate for a first-year member.</p>

            Because record books are due annually, the defacto time-limit for all record book goals is the record book due date;
            so the time component isn't a deal-breaker.
            It really shows initiative and professionalism, though, if you set a deadline <em>before</em> record books are due.</p>

      <p>How do you write SMARTY goals? Here's a way I like to do it:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Get a blank sheet of paper and pencil (<strong>not</strong> your phone or computer)</li>
        <li>Write the project name and why you enrolled in that project at the top of the page</li>
        <li>Write four or five things you would like to accomplish in that project (these don't have to be SMARTY)</li>
        <li>Set aside your page for two months</li>
        <li>For each of those things you wanted to do, write a SMARTY version</li>
        <li>Add your new goals to your record book</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I've found that, by writing down the goals early along with the why behind them, I will be more likely to accomplish my goals.
        Try it yourself, and I think you will, too.</p>
      <h2><a id="projectdescription"></a>Project Description</h2>
      <blockquote> If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself. <small>Albert Einstein</small> </blockquote>
      <p> Use the project description to explain what you did in the past year to someone who doesn't know anything about that subject.
        A good project description should read almost like a newspaper brief about your project.
        Like a good reporter, include the following information on your project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Who</strong> (parents, siblings, project leaders) </li>
        <li> <strong>What</strong> (leathercraft halter, market steer show, cooking recipe) </li>
        <li> <strong>When</strong> (at fair, at the spring judging contest, at home all year) </li>
        <li> and </li>
        <li> <strong>Where</strong> (at Hansen arena, at home, at SAREC) </li>

        <div class="panel-body">Most of our record book examples don't follow these guidelines, because these guidelines hadn't been written yet! Please use discernment when viewing the example project descriptions, and remember to use the reporter-like style when completing your record book.

      <p>&quot;Size &amp; Scope&quot; isn't nearly as confusing as it might sound.

      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>Size</dt>

        <dd>indicates the varieties, different types, recipes, plants or animal breeds with which you worked.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p> In short, Size &amp; Scope is a quantitative analysis of everything you used to complete your project.
        Good Size &amp; Scope sections vary widely depending on the project, but all of them record the items (physical or intellectual) used in the project, and the time and money spent on the project.
        Take a look at the examples for ideas to get you started. </p>

      <p> Knowledge &amp; Skills Acquired serves two purposes.
        First, it allows you to address whether or not you met your goals.
        Second, it tells readers what you actually learned this year in your project. </p>
      <p> To complete Knowledge &amp; Skills, create a heading for each <a href="#goals">goal</a> you wrote.
        Write a paragraph (at least three sentences) explaining if you met the goal, how you met the goal (or why you did not meet the goal), and what you learned from the goal.
        After each goal is addressed, include paragraphs explaining anything else you learned about your project area.
        Remember that your readers might not know anything about your project area, so be sure to explain it in a way that a layperson can understand. </p>

		<p>
			When you compete in the county fair or other 4-H contest with your project, list that competition here and list what place you got.
			If you have a project that involves multiple items (e.g. a knitted scarf <em>and</em> a knitted hat), list both of those items and the placings each received.
			If you exhibited your project at multiple shows (e.g. a heifer at the Colorado Dairy Extravaganza, the Brown Swiss State Show, and the County fair), feel free to restructure the columns to match the exhibitions you actually attended.
